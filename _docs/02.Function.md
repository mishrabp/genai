# Problem
A problem with Gen AI is that it does not give you real-time information like stock value, weather condition. This is because Gen AI uses LLMs which are trained on the past data. 

# Solution (Function Calling)
In the context of Generative AI (Gen AI), function calling refers to the ability of an AI model, particularly a language model like GPT, to invoke or call external functions, APIs, or services based on the context or instructions given to it. This functionality enables the AI model to not only generate text but also interact with other systems, retrieve real-time data, perform calculations, or trigger processes outside of its own internal knowledge.

Function calling in Gen AI is particularly useful for creating dynamic and interactive applications.
