# Building a GenAI-Powered Investment Planning Assistant: Understanding the Role of LLMs, RAG, Tools, and Agents

In the world of financial advising, providing users with personalized, up-to-date investment advice is a challenge. With the rise of **Generative AI (GenAI)**, we now have powerful tools and frameworks that can assist in building smarter, more efficient financial planning applications. In this blog, we'll explore how to leverage **LLMs (Large Language Models)**, **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, **Tools**, **Functions**, **Agents**, and **Agent Orchestrators** to create an intelligent investment planning assistant. By the end of this post, you'll have a clear understanding of the role each component plays in developing such an application.

## 1. LLM (Large Language Model): The Conversational Engine

The **LLM** serves as the core conversational engine of your investment planning application. It interacts directly with the user, understanding queries, providing explanations, and suggesting possible investment strategies.

### What LLMs Can Do:
- **Handle conversations**: They are excellent at understanding and responding to natural language input.
- **Provide general knowledge**: They can explain financial concepts (e.g., "What is risk tolerance?" or "How do bonds work?").

**Example**:
**User**: "I want to save for retirement. Can you help me?"  
**LLM**: "Absolutely! To get started, how old are you, and when do you plan to retire? Also, what is your preferred level of investment risk?"

However, **LLMs** are typically trained on **historical data** and **static knowledge**. They are not designed to fetch **real-time data** like current stock prices or market movements. For this, we need additional tools and frameworks.

## 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Enhancing with Relevant Data

While **LLMs** can generate intelligent responses, they can only provide generalized knowledge from their training data. To provide **real-time, domain-specific, or historical data**, we introduce **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). **RAG** allows the system to retrieve relevant data from external sources and use it to generate more accurate, contextual responses.

### How RAG Works:
- **Retrieval**: The system queries external sources (like databases, documents, or APIs) to fetch information.
- **Augmentation**: The retrieved data is fed into the **LLM**, which then incorporates this data to generate a more accurate response.

**Example**:
**User**: "How has the XYZ Mutual Fund performed over the last 5 years?"  
- **LLM's General Response**: "Mutual funds typically vary in performance depending on market conditions and the fund manager."  
- **RAG Augmented Response**: The system retrieves performance data for XYZ Mutual Fund from an external source and provides specific data, e.g., "XYZ Mutual Fund has delivered an average annual return of 7.5% over the past five years."

**What RAG Cannot Do**: RAG cannot fetch **real-time data** like current stock prices or execute transactions. For these tasks, a **Tool** is required.

## 3. Tool: Fetching Real-Time Data and Performing Actions

**Tools** are used to interact with **external systems**, especially for **real-time data** retrieval and **actionable tasks**. These could include **retrieving live stock prices**, **executing trades**, or **accessing financial APIs**.

### Examples of Tools:
- **Stock Price APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, IEX Cloud)**: Used to fetch real-time stock prices and market data.
- **Plaid API**: Provides access to users' bank accounts, helping them track investments and finances.
- **Interactive Brokers API**: Can be used to execute trades, helping users manage their portfolios directly from the application.

**Example**:
**User**: "What is the current price of Tesla stock?"  
- The **LLM** requests a **Tool** (e.g., the **Stock Price API**) to fetch the current price of Tesla and respond with: "The current price of Tesla stock is $345.67."

**What Tools Cannot Do**: Tools don't provide complex conversational capabilities or generate personalized financial advice. They are specialized for fetching data or performing transactions.

## 4. Function: Performing Calculations and Logic

A **Function** is a unit of logic that handles tasks like **calculating investment returns**, **assessing risk**, or **projecting future growth** based on user input. It provides the essential business logic for any financial application.

### Examples of Functions:
- **Risk Assessment Models**: Functions that calculate the risk level of a portfolio based on asset types and market conditions.
- **Return Projections**: Functions that calculate the expected returns of an investment over time, factoring in compounding interest and inflation.
- **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Functions that assess the user’s current portfolio and recommend rebalancing actions based on risk preferences or market conditions.

**Example**:
**User**: "If I invest $5,000 at 7% annual return, how much will I have in 10 years?"  
- The **Function** uses a **compound interest formula** to calculate the future value and responds: "Your $5,000 investment will grow to $9,671 in 10 years at a 7% annual return."

**What Functions Cannot Do**: Functions cannot manage the entire workflow or interact directly with external APIs. They are designed to handle calculations and logic within specific tasks.

## 5. Agent: Orchestrating Tasks and User Interactions

An **Agent** is responsible for orchestrating the tasks needed to fulfill a user's request. It communicates with the **LLM**, **RAG**, **Tools**, and **Functions**, coordinating these resources to accomplish a goal.

### Key Features of Agents:
- **Workflow management**: Agents delegate tasks like data retrieval, performing calculations, and generating responses.
- **User Interaction**: They maintain the conversation with the user, ensuring that all steps are aligned with the user’s goals.

**Example**:
**User**: "Help me build an investment portfolio for my retirement. I have $10,000 to invest and a moderate risk tolerance."  
- The **Agent**:
  1. Asks for additional details (e.g., age, investment goals).
  2. Uses **RAG** to retrieve information on appropriate funds.
  3. Calls the **Function** to calculate projected returns.
  4. Uses **Tools** to fetch real-time data like stock prices or fund performance.
  5. Generates a personalized portfolio for the user.

**What Agents Cannot Do**: Agents do not fetch real-time data or perform calculations themselves. They rely on other components to complete tasks.

---

## 6. Agent Orchestrator: Coordinating Multiple Agents

The **Agent Orchestrator** is responsible for managing multiple agents and ensuring they work together smoothly. It coordinates tasks, prioritizes workflows, and tracks the overall progress of user goals.

### Key Features of Agent Orchestrators:
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: The orchestrator makes sure that various agents work together without conflicts.
- **Task Monitoring**: It ensures that all tasks (like portfolio creation, risk assessment, and market monitoring) are executed in the right order.

**Example**:
**User**: "Help me create an investment plan and monitor it over time."  
- The **Orchestrator** assigns different tasks to agents:
  1. One agent handles **portfolio creation**.
  2. Another tracks **market conditions** and makes recommendations.
  3. A third agent monitors **performance** and provides regular updates.
  4. The orchestrator ensures the agents work seamlessly, keeping the user informed at every step.

**What Agent Orchestrators Cannot Do**: They don’t directly interact with users or perform the tasks themselves. They focus on ensuring everything runs smoothly.

## Putting It All Together: How These Components Work in the Investment Planning Application

Let's visualize how these components come together to create a **GenAI-powered investment planning assistant**:

1. **User Interaction**: The **LLM** collects details about the user's financial goals and preferences.
2. **Data Retrieval**: **RAG** fetches historical or domain-specific data about potential investment options, such as fund performance or risk levels.
3. **Calculations**: **Functions** perform the necessary calculations, such as projecting returns or assessing risk.
4. **Personalized Strategy**: The **Agent** combines all the data and generates a personalized investment plan for the user.
5. **Execution**: **Tools** fetch live stock prices and execute trades or updates in real-time.
6. **Ongoing Monitoring**: The **Agent Orchestrator** ensures that agents continue to track progress, suggest adjustments, and keep the user updated.
