    "# Git Merge and Conflict Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "In Git, `git merge` is used to combine changes from one branch into another. During the merge process, conflicts may arise when changes in the two branches interfere with each other. Git provides tools to resolve these conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git Merge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare your branches:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Assume you have two branches, `master` and `feature-branch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git checkout master\n",
    "   $ git pull origin master\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git checkout feature-branch\n",
    "   $ git pull origin feature-branch\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Merge `feature-branch` into `master`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git checkout master\n",
    "   $ git merge feature-branch\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command attempts to merge changes from `feature-branch` into `master`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Before merge:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "      master            feature-branch\n",
    "        |                     |\n",
    "        V                     V\n",
    "A --- B --- C           A --- B --- D\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After merge:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "       master\n",
    "         |\n",
    "         V\n",
    "A --- B --- C --- E\n",
    "        \\      /\n",
    "         \\    /\n",
    "          D (merged)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this diagram, commit `E` is the merge commit that combines changes from both `master` and `feature-branch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conflict Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Merge Conflict?\n",
    "\n",
    "A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences between branches. This happens when changes to the same line(s) in the same file are made differently in both branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create conflicting changes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   In `master`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ echo \"Line from master\" >> file.txt\n",
    "   $ git add file.txt\n",
    "   $ git commit -m \"Add line from master\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In `feature-branch`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ echo \"Line from feature-branch\" >> file.txt\n",
    "   $ git add file.txt\n",
    "   $ git commit -m \"Add line from feature-branch\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attempt to merge and encounter a conflict:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git checkout master\n",
    "   $ git merge feature-branch\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Git will notify you of the conflict:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   Auto-merging file.txt\n",
    "   CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt\n",
    "   Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resolve the conflict:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Open `file.txt` in your text editor. It will show conflict markers:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   <<<<<<< HEAD\n",
    "   Line from master\n",
    "   =======\n",
    "   Line from feature-branch\n",
    "   >>>>>>> feature-branch\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Edit the file to resolve the conflict:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   Line from master\n",
    "   Line from feature-branch\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mark the conflict as resolved and complete the merge:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git add file.txt\n",
    "   $ git commit -m \"Resolve merge conflict\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Conflict resolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "       master\n",
    "         |\n",
    "         V\n",
    "A --- B --- C --- E\n",
    "        \\      /\n",
    "         \\    /\n",
    "          D (merged)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "During the merge of `C` and `D`, a conflict occurs in `file.txt`, which is then manually resolved and committed as `E`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`git merge`**: Combines changes from one branch into another. Conflicts can occur if changes interfere with each other.\n",
    "- **Conflict Resolution**: Involves manually resolving differences in conflicting files and marking the conflicts as resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how to merge branches and resolve conflicts is essential for managing changes and collaborating in a Git repository.\n"
