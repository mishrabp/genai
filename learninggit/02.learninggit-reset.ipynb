    "# Use Case: Correcting a Mistake in Recent Commits Using `git reset`\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `git reset` can be a powerful tool for adjusting your commit history. Let's consider a practical use case where you might want to use `git reset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are working on a feature branch and you realize that the last three commits contain some mistakes or unwanted changes. You want to undo these commits and make corrections. Here's how you can use `git reset` to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have the following commit history:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    A -- B -- C -- D -- E -- F -- G (feature)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Commits `E`, `F`, and `G` contain mistakes that you want to correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Correct the Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Reset to a Previous Commit\n",
    "\n",
    "You decide to undo the last three commits (`E`, `F`, and `G`). To do this, you use `git reset` to move `HEAD` and the current branch pointer back to commit `D`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git reset --soft HEAD~3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `--soft`: This option keeps your changes in the working directory and staging area.\n",
    "- `HEAD~3`: This points to the commit three steps back from `HEAD` (commit `D`).\n",
    "\n",
    "After this command, your commit history will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A -- B -- C -- D (feature)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But the changes from `E`, `F`, and `G` will still be in your working directory and staged for commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Review and Correct Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can review and make corrections to the changes from the last three commits. Open your files and make the necessary modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Stage and Commit the Corrected Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have corrected the changes, you can add them to the staging area and create a new commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "git commit -m \"Corrected changes from commits E, F, and G\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your new commit history will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A -- B -- C -- D -- H (feature)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `H` is the new commit containing the corrected changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation of Other Reset Options\n",
    "\n",
    "### `--mixed` (default)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had used `git reset --mixed HEAD~3`, your changes would be removed from the staging area but kept in the working directory. This would allow you to selectively add files back to the staging area before committing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `--hard`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had used `git reset --hard HEAD~3`, both your staging area and working directory would be reset to match commit `D`. This means all changes from commits `E`, `F`, and `G` would be lost, so use this option with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git reset --soft HEAD~3`: Moves `HEAD` back three commits, keeps changes staged.\n",
    "- `git reset --mixed HEAD~3`: Moves `HEAD` back three commits, keeps changes in the working directory.\n",
    "- `git reset --hard HEAD~3`: Moves `HEAD` back three commits, discards changes in the working directory and staging area.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This requires `git push --force` to push the change into origin\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `git reset`, you can effectively correct mistakes in recent commits, giving you the flexibility to manage your commit history and ensure your repository stays clean and accurate.\n"
