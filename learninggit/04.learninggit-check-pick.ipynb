    "# Using `git cherry-pick` in Git: A Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In Git, `git cherry-pick` is used to apply changes from a specific commit (or commits) to the current branch. This is useful when you want to introduce changes from one branch into another without merging the entire branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You have made a commit on a feature branch that you want to apply to the `master` branch without merging the entire feature branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the commit to cherry-pick:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Use `git log` to find the hash of the commit you want to cherry-pick. For example, assume the commit hash is `abc1234`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git log\n",
    "   commit abc1234\n",
    "   Author: Your Name <your.email@example.com>\n",
    "   Date:   Thu Jun 23 12:34:56 2023 +0000\n",
    "\n",
    "       Added a new feature\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check out the branch where you want to apply the commit:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git checkout master\n",
    "   Switched to branch 'master'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cherry-pick the commit:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git cherry-pick abc1234\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command applies the changes from commit `abc1234` to the `master` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resolve any conflicts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If there are any conflicts, Git will pause the cherry-pick process and prompt you to resolve them. After resolving conflicts, you can continue the cherry-pick:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git add <resolved-files>\n",
    "   $ git cherry-pick --continue\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git push origin master\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Before cherry-pick:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "      master\n",
    "        |\n",
    "        V\n",
    "A --- B --- C (feature-branch, abc1234)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After cherry-pick:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "      master\n",
    "        |\n",
    "        V\n",
    "A --- B --- D (master)\n",
    "        \\   ^\n",
    "         \\ /\n",
    "          C (feature-branch, abc1234)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this diagram, commit `D` on the `master` branch is the result of cherry-picking commit `C` from the `feature-branch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `git cherry-pick` allows you to selectively apply changes from one branch to another. This is particularly useful when you want to introduce specific features or fixes from a feature branch into the main branch without merging all the changes from the feature branch.\n"
