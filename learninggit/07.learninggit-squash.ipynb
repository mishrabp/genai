    "# Using `git rebase` to Squash Commits in Git\n",
    "\n",
    "In Git, squashing commits means combining multiple commit entries into one. This is often done to clean up a messy commit history before merging a feature branch into the main branch. The `git rebase` command is commonly used for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a feature branch with multiple commits, and you want to squash them into a single commit before merging into the `master` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **View the commit history:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git log --oneline\n",
    "   abc1234 Add feature part 3\n",
    "   def5678 Add feature part 2\n",
    "   ghi9101 Add feature part 1\n",
    "   jkl1122 Initial commit\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Start an interactive rebase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git rebase -i HEAD~3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command initiates an interactive rebase for the last 3 commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mark commits to squash:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the interactive rebase editor, change `pick` to `squash` (or `s`) for the commits you want to squash:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   pick ghi9101 Add feature part 1\n",
    "   squash def5678 Add feature part 2\n",
    "   squash abc1234 Add feature part 3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Save and close the editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Edit the commit message:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Git will open a new editor window to edit the commit message for the squashed commits. You can combine the commit messages or create a new one:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   Add feature\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Add feature part 1\n",
    "   - Add feature part 2\n",
    "   - Add feature part 3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Save and close the editor to complete the rebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git push origin feature-branch --force\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Before squashing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "      feature-branch\n",
    "            |\n",
    "            V\n",
    "A --- B --- C --- D\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After squashing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "      feature-branch\n",
    "            |\n",
    "            V\n",
    "A --- B --- E\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this diagram, commit `E` is the result of squashing commits `C` and `D` into a single commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Squashing Commits**: Combines multiple commits into one to clean up commit history.\n",
    "- **Interactive Rebase**: Use `git rebase -i` to interactively squash commits.\n",
    "- **Push with Force**: After squashing commits, use `git push --force` to update the remote branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how to squash commits helps maintain a clean and readable commit history, making it easier for others to understand the changes in your project.\n"
