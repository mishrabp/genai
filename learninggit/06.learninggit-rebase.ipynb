    "# Git Rebase: Updating Feature Branch with `git rebase`\n",
    "\n",
    "In Git, `git rebase` is used to reapply commits on top of another base commit. This can be useful when you want to update a feature branch with the latest changes from the main branch (`master`), while keeping a cleaner commit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case: Rebasing `feature-branch` onto `master`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check out `master` and pull latest changes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git checkout master\n",
    "   $ git pull origin master\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check out `feature-branch` and rebase onto `master`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git checkout feature-branch\n",
    "   $ git rebase master\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This replays the commits from `feature-branch` on top of the latest `master`, effectively incorporating the changes from `master` into your feature branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resolve any conflicts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If there are any conflicts, Git will pause the rebase process and prompt you to resolve them. After resolving conflicts, you can continue the rebase:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git rebase --continue\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Complete the rebase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Once the rebase is complete, your `feature-branch` will be up-to-date with `master`, and you can push your changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git push origin feature-branch\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Rebase:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                (master)\n",
    "                    |\n",
    "                    V\n",
    "A --- B --- C --- D (feature-branch)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After Rebase:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                          (master)\n",
    "                              |\n",
    "                              V\n",
    "A --- B --- C --- D --- E' (feature-branch)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `E'` represents the same changes as `D` but applied on top of the latest `master` commit. The commit `D` is abandoned in favor of the new commit `E'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `git rebase` in this way can help maintain a cleaner commit history by incorporating changes from `master` into feature branches before merging them back.\n"
