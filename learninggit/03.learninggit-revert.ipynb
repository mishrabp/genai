    "# Using `git revert` in Git: A Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In Git, `git revert` is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made by a previous commit. This is useful when you need to undo a specific commit without altering the commit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You have made a commit to the `master` branch that introduces a bug. You want to undo this commit by creating a new commit that reverts the changes introduced by the problematic commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the commit to revert:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Use `git log` to find the hash of the commit you want to revert. For example, assume the commit hash is `abc1234`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git log\n",
    "   commit abc1234\n",
    "   Author: Your Name <your.email@example.com>\n",
    "   Date:   Thu Jun 23 12:34:56 2023 +0000\n",
    "\n",
    "       Introduced a bug\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Revert the commit:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Use `git revert` followed by the commit hash to create a new commit that undoes the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git revert abc1234\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command opens the default text editor for you to edit the commit message for the revert commit. After saving and closing the editor, a new commit is created that reverts the changes introduced by `abc1234`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   $ git push origin master\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reverting a Commit\n",
    "\n",
    "Before revert:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A --- B --- C (master, abc1234)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After revert:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A --- B --- C --- D (master)\n",
    "              \\   ^\n",
    "               \\ /\n",
    "            Revert of C\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this diagram, commit `D` is the new commit that reverts the changes introduced by commit `C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `git revert` in this way allows you to undo changes introduced by a specific commit without rewriting the commit history. This is particularly useful in collaborative environments where preserving the commit history is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commit D does not revert the repository back to the state of commit B. Instead, it only undoes the changes made by commit C while preserving any changes made by commits after C. The history remains linear and retains all commits for a complete history.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Difference Between Reset and Revert\n",
    "\n",
    "## History Tracking\n",
    "- git reset: Modifies the commit history by moving the branch pointer. It can discard commits if used with --hard.\n",
    "- git revert: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit, preserving the commit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Safety\n",
    "- git reset: Can be disruptive if used in shared repositories, especially with --hard, as it can rewrite history and discard changes.\n",
    "- git revert: Safe for use in shared repositories as it does not rewrite history.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case\n",
    "- git reset: Useful for undoing changes in your local repository before sharing them, cleaning up commits, or adjusting the branch pointer.\n",
    "- git revert: Ideal for undoing specific commits in a way that maintains a clear and accurate history, especially in collaborative environments.\n"
